        <h2 class="cname">Carrie Aubin</h2>
            <p>Carrie is an outright fanatic of Netflix and trivia (double whammy!). Her knowledge of geography is profound and expanse as
            she has lived in multiple countries. She helped create this game to put her geography trivia skills to the test (disclaimer: sheâ€™s
            a geo-trivia whiz!).</p>

        <h2 class="cname">Jovanka Milosevic</h2>
            <p>Jovanka is a dedicated follower of TV shows and movies (she owns a VPN!). Geography may as well be her middle name or the back
            of her hand because she is a pro at it. She helped create this game to extend her vast intellect of geography to people across
            many oceans!</p>

        <h2 class="cname">Maizy Serrao</h2>
            <p>Maizy is an avid sudoku player and fan of board games (nerd!). However, her knowledge of geography trivia is limited and dwindling.
            She helped create this game to help herself and others improve their geography trivia skills.</p>
